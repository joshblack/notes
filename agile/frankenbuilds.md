- build outcomes over output, We need to build value
- Target Outcome Frameworks
- Velocity, and other estimated measures, are all just getting in the way of finding out our outcomes
- How to get started
  - Understand what's really going on
  - Lean is about reducing waste, making things more efficient, and LEARNING!
  - Checkout: a3 thinking from Toyota, systemic reasons and why we have problems and causes for things
  - Become the method actor of user experience
  - Never ask your users what they want, and _never_ ask the developers what they think the user wants
  - Get out of your chair and find out what they need
  - IDEO: We create empathy, we build personas to remind us that real people use our products
