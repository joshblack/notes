# Frankenbuilds - If Agile is so good, why are our Products so bad?

- build outcomes over output, We need to build value
- Target Outcome Frameworks
- Velocity, and other estimated measures, are all just getting in the way of finding out our outcomes
- How to get started
  - Understand what's really going on
  - Lean is about reducing waste, making things more efficient, and LEARNING!
  - Checkout: a3 thinking from Toyota, systemic reasons and why we have problems and causes for things
  - Become the method actor of user experience
  - Never ask your users what they want, and _never_ ask the developers what they think the user wants
  - Get out of your chair and find out what they need
  - IDEO: We create empathy, we build personas to remind us that real people use our products
  - Each user has a goal, a job to get done
  - Figure out what it is that they want to do, iterate to make that process better and better
  - Find core jobs, make them as easy as possible to do
  - Once you know where you are, figure out where you want to be
  - Do deep thinking, value stream mapping, 5 y's, 
  - Impact mapping: choose the right outcomes by measuring the severity of the problem or size of the opportunity
  - 80/20 thinking caps (20% of the features is used 80% of the time)
  - Agile has a great way to get products out quickly, need to find the right 20 to build
  - Understand where is the greatest upside
  - Set target outcomes
  - Target outcomes are the poke yoke of product development
  - They make it easy to build the right thing and hard to build the wrong thing (think floppy disks, only one way to put it in a computer)
  - Helps us tell which features to put in, and which features not to build
  - We can build features quickly, we need to know which ones are the right ones to build
  - Target outcomes need to be clear and measurable
  - Need a good baseline, need data to help determine that baseline
  - If you don't measure how will you know when you get there?
  - Can you quantify everything?
    - We're not measuring to get the most precise number
    - We're trying to get down to a level of understanding where it's easy to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing
  - Target outcomes set a direction, and th ere are many ways to achieve it
  - Options Thinking
  - When you plan based on outputs, you commit to a certain future
    - This is what we think we're going to do, danger is that we're defining it up-front, it has a life of it's own
  - Stop pretending you can see the future and _create options_
  - Have multiple ideas
  - Keep your options open, be ready to execute rapidly
    - Make decisions as reversible as possible, and irreversible decisions as late as possibly
  - It's about arrival, not surival, of the fittest. Surivival is the slowest form of suicide
    - It's the people who can get to market with the right product the quickest, not the ones who can just suriveve
  - Outcomes and options are fractal
    - Reach, engagement, for example. Should align to every area of development right down to the quality of your systems
  - Each one leads to another
  - It's more tree-based, than a linear product backlog (very tactical thinking, keep hacking things together and hoping for a good result)
  - There are no product requirements, they are product guesses. Stop guessing and start testing
  - Run multiple options fast, make the unknowns known
  - Set based design, run options concurrently on the mark
  - Get in front of your users early and often
  - Seeing is believing, research is too important to leave up to the researches
  - Yahoo used to show developers and bring them on field trips to show them that people don't use it
  - Ignore your mother, be fast, dirty, and cheap
  - Give away free lunch every friday and have people use your product, get feedback!
  - More features are actually a problem, remove the inessentials so the essentials can speak
  - When the iPhone came out, they had 40% less of the features than their competitors
  - The game is to hit the target with as few bullets as possible
  - Velocity, cycle time measures, are all for throughput. Tells developers to build as much as possible.
  - Set a game target, we need to get here quickly with _as few features as possible_
  - Minimum viable and not maximum potential
  - Measure as you go to check and see if you're in the right direction
  - Setup automated metric frameworks
  - Do you have usage statistics, 
  - If your metrics lag, you lag
  - Multivariate testing, skip testing in a room and send it out
  - Metrics gathering is meant for everyone, especially developers
  - Transparency is key, share the data with the entire development team
  - Progress indicators tell if you you're on track
  - The most important thing to see is not burndown charts, it's about seeing if target outcomes validate the investment
- How do we know if we've succeeded?
  - If we are not hitting the target outcomes, adapt
- Agilistas are killing the planet
- When you use the machine gun approach you build more features fast
- The more featuers you build the more resources you consume
- Save the features, save the planet
