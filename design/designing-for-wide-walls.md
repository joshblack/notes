## Notes

There's an interesting point that Resnick brings up that came from his mentor, Seymour Papert, where Seymour says:

> For a technology to be effective, he said, it should provide easy ways for novices to get started (low floor) but also ways for them to work on increasingly sophisticated projects over time (high ceiling).

And this idea seems incredibly powerful as it seems to cover such a wide range of topics, and explains our initial reactions to most things. While Resnick applies this in the context of technology, it can very easily be applied to whether or not we'll play a new video game, try out a new recipe, etc. This can be taken further into anything that we would engage with consistently, as the level of our engagement corresponds to how easily we can get up-and-running, and subsequently how far we can take our craft.

The important distinction that Resnick makes in this post is that it's no longer good enough to just have this dichotomy of a low floor and a high ceiling, we also need to have wide walls. The wide wall analogy tries to pinpoint the fact that we need to connect with what we're working on in a way that's personally meaningful to us. As Resnick admits, it's impossible to create a single project that will be meanginful to all kids. As a result, high engagement only comes from appealing to all. And this universal appeal comes from support for a wide diversity of pathways.

This support for a wide diversity of pathways seems incredibly important right now. As Resnick notes in his final paragraph:

> Our ultimate goal is to help all kids develop their thinking, develop their voices, and develop their identities. None of that will happen unless we continually ask: Who are we including? Who are we excluding? And how can we provide everyone—everyone—with opportunities for exploring, experimenting, and expressing themselves.

This ultimately should be our goal in Technology. There's no excuse for us to not leverage technology to make sure that we include all in the things we create. In the past, the mere scale of having to support so many use-cases may have been incredibly daunting. And, as a result, some things might have slipped. But now, we have these machines capable of doing fantastic things. Machines that are finally capable of tackling the scaling issues that have plagued us for so long. It'd be a shame if we couldn't use them to help in this area.
