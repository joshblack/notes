## Notes

Alice Rawsthorn presents a great piece on how we enable choices for people in a digital world. The preamble provides a very clear context for why this is important in the physical world, with an incredible example of a young woman endlessly fighting for the choice of individuality in an industrialized pipeline.

It quickly becomes clear that Rawsthorn is walking a very fine line between the endless sea of possibilities, and a path most chosen. It's seemingly an endless struggle that never quite reaches equilibrium as each side fights to be heard. I think it's brilliant to see that, as humans, we have groups of individuals who very quickly want to standardize a process in order to create something cheap and usable for the masses. Yet, with this mass-production comes trade-offs. And it becomes increasingly important that we pick the right trade-offs.

Picking the right trade-offs is immediately present when we look at the physical world. We live in buildings that need to follow some degree of codes and regulations, yet each one offers some kind of variance from its immediate neighbors. In this example, the lack of choice imposed on us has a positive impact, and provides a guarantee of safety.

In a digital world, it seems that choice can manifest itself in many mays. I think the most common representations of this fall into the categories of WYSIWYG editors, drag-and-drop UI interfaces, and other customization tools that affect the user on the surface. When Rawsthorn highlighted the process of Facebook's eventual change of a "gender options" UI element into a free-form field, I think it becomes very clear that the choices that are important to us are the ones that allow us to define ourselves. This can be in a direct way, such as in the "gender options" presented in the previous example, or it can be in an indirect way the same way we can customize our clothes or our homes.

I think Rawsthorn hits on this point very well, saying:

> Choice will be a defining element of design in future. As our personal identities become subtler and more singular, we will wish to make increasingly nuanced choices about the design of many aspects of our lives.

While this makes obvious sense in a consumer context, I'm really curious what this means in an enterprise/professional setting.
