### Highlights

1. Lecturing
  - Evey lecture should make only one point, and should re-iterate on that point multiple times for full-effect.
  - Don't ever run overtime!
  - Relate to your audience, "Everyone in the audience has come to listen to your lecture with the secret hope of hearing their work mentioned."
  - Give the audeince something to take home.
2. Blackboard (Whiteboard now?) Technique
  - Make sure the board is spotless
  - Start writing on the top-left hand corner. Just think of the people copying what you're saying down in their notebooks!
3. Publish the same result serveral times
  - Iteration is the most valuable process.
  - Start getting feedback early and often and with whoever you can
4. You are more likely to be remembered by your expository work
  - Talks about famous mathematicians and how they became known not for their original work, or what they were good at, but by popular publishing efforts that were just updated regurgitations of previous thoughts.
5. Ever mathematician has only a few tricks
  - Pretty much what the title says. Even the best of us rely on repeating tricks that we know to get results. These are definitely what we're comfortable in, but perhaps it's because we know they can reliably product results
6. Do not worry about your mistakes
  - There are two kinds of mistakes: fatal ones that destroy a theory, and contingent ones which are useful in testing the stability of a theory
  - This paragraph is pretty interesting, want to revisit to see if there are other insights to get out of it that apply to CS
7. Use the Feynman method
  - Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: "How did he do it? He must be a genius!"
8. Give lavish acknowledgements
  - Give credit when credit is due, and sometimes just give credit anyways.
9. Write informative introductions
  - Motivate people as to the why, even back then people rarely had the time or patience to go through something. Now, even less so. Provide an enticing outline or some form of motivator to hook the reader to engage them effectively.
10. Be prepared for old age
  - "My late friend Stan Ulam used to remark that his life was sharply divided into two halves. In the first half, he was always the youngest person in the group; in the second half, he was always the oldest. There was no transitional period."
