# Types

Understanding computing, algorithms, and how they tie into Category Theory and type systems.

## History

An algorithm is a sequence of instructions followed by a computer. Traditionally this computer was thought of as the person who executed each instruction. However, now we think of this as a device that handles the exeuction for us.

A formal mathematical definition of computation didn't appear until the 1930s when Church, Gödel, and Turing all published papers about effective computability, including:

- _Lambda Calculus_: An unsolvable problem of elementary number theory, Alonzo Church, May 1935
- _Recursive Functions_: Stephen Kleene, General recursive functions of natural numbers, Kurt Gödel, July 1935
- _Turing Machines_: On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem, Alan Turing, May 1936
