# Intercom

Intercom has a great podcast that they host every couple of weeks, where they talk about topics related to product, design, start-ups, and more.

Some of their Product-related segments are invaluable, as they show how VPs of Product think about Product and Product Management, while also sharing their own tips and strategies for building Products today.

Below are some of the podcasts that stick out that I've frequently come back to, they may or may not have notes attached to them.

- When youâ€™re building a product, you have to balance the day to day to day activities with the long term vision, thinking in terms of six years, six months, and six weeks.
- Getting the balance right between competing priorities in your product is only achieved by having a well defined roadmap, with clearly defined inputs.
- Most companies focus on 10% incremental improvements. Aiming for a 10x improvement, ten times better than what exists today, can help redefine the problem entirely.
